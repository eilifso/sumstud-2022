	# Physics jokes

## Relatively slow

Einstein developed a thery about space. And boy, was it about time, too!

## Is it all lies?

Why can't you trust an atom?

They make up everything.

##Hide and seek

Alle the physicists meet up in heaven and decide to play a game of hide and seek. They decide that Fermi will be the seeker, so he closes his eyes and starts counting to 100.

All the physicists scatter, except for Newton, who calmly reaches into his pocket, takes out some chalk, and draws a square one metre on a side.

Fermi finishes counting and turns around, seeing Newton standing in his chalk square he yells "Ifound Newton. Newton is out!"

Newton protests: "No, I'm Newton in a meter square; I'm Pascal. Pascal is out!"

##Ways to use a barometer to find the height of a building
1. Measure the height of the barometer. Scale the side of the building, measuring its height in barometer-units.
2. Drop the barometer from the top of the building. Measure the time until it hits the street. Correcting for the mass/surface ratio of the instrument, use basic acceleration equation to find the height.
3. Tie string to top of barometer. Lower from roof to almost ground. Swing. Period of pendulum can be used to find distance from barometer's Center of Gravity to top of building.
4.Tie string to top of barometer. Lower from roof to almost ground. Swing. Period of pendulum can be used to find distance from barometer's Center of Gravity to top of building.
