## Relatively slow

Einstein developed a thery about space. And boy, was it about time, too!

## Is it all lies?

Why can't you trust an atom?

They make up everything.

##Hide and seek

Alle the physicists meet up in heaven and decide to play a game of hide and seek. They decide that Fermi will be the seeker, so he closes his eyes and starts counting to 100.

All the physicists scatter, except for Newton, who calmly reaches into his pocket, takes out some chalk, and draws a square one metre on a side.

Fermi finishes counting and turns around, seeing Newton standing in his chalk square he yells "Ifound Newton. Newton is out!"

Newton protests: "No, I'm Newton in a meter square; I'm Pascal. Pascal is out!"
