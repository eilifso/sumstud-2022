(1991) , a set of problems designed to test hydrodynamics Riemann solvers are described, and among them is the Einfeldt-1203 test. We will compare the quantities we get from the Bifrost and Ramses solvers with figure 11 in Stone et al. in order to verify the performance of our solvers. Additionally we can look at other sources like Carrillo, H. et al. or B. Einfeldt et al. , in which the analytical solutions have a slightly different shape, the main difference being the horizontal velocity, which has a much softer \"step\" in the center than the reference figure in Stone et al. As described in Stone et al. , the initial right and left values are as follows: $\\rho$ $v_x$ $v_y$ $v_z$ $P$ $B_x$ $B_z$ Left side 1.0 -2.0 0 0 0.4 ... ... Right side 1.0 2.0 0 0 0.4 ... ... In other words, the Einfeldt-1203 test consists of separating the domain with an imaginary membrane, and having the horizontal velocity be negative on one side and positive on the other side. We will then observe how the other parameters change when the imaginary membrane is yanked away, creating a shockwave that propagates through the domain. Bifrost with stagger2 We begin with the Bifrost solver, using using $\\gamma = 1.4$, and simulating until $t=0.1$ s. Plotting the final density $\\rho$, pressure $P$, horizontal velocity $u_x$ and $P/\\rho$ (the specific internal energy scaled by ($\\gamma - 1$)) in the x-direction yields figure 1: Comparing our plot with figure 11 in Stone et al. , we can immediately see that the x-axis has different values. This should have no effect on the shape of the plots, and we therefore choose not to bother with changing the x-axis to replicate the figure. We also see that the shape of the specific internal energy ($P/\\rho$) is different from the reference figure, and that it does not extend down quite as far as it should. The reason for this might be that we are plotting the wrong variable, or that it is somehow scaled differently in the paper. (We plot the specific internal energy as: p/rho , where `p = rho * (gamma - 1) * ee . ) However, the pressure and density plots seem to fit the reference figure very nicely, and therefore we assume the results are valid, and we choose to only look at the density, pressure and velocity plots when fine-tuning the Bifrost parameters. We can examine the time evolution of the einfeldt problem by plotting a specific snapshot. The biggest changes happen in the earliest snapshots, since the system begins in an extreme initial state, which it will very quickly try to even out. The following gif shows how the system changes from snapshots 0 (the initial state) to snapshot 20 (the end time $t=0.1$ s. Further on, we can modify each of the Bifrost parameters $\\nu_1$, $\\nu_2$, $\\nu_3$, $\\nu_d$, $\\nu_{ee}$ and $\\eta_3$ in order to fine-tune the solver to better match the results in Stone et al. I found that changing the Bifrost parameters one by one did little in terms of the density and pressure plots. The biggest changes are seen in the plot of the specific internal energy $P/\\rho$. The initial parameters are as follows: Parameter $\\nu_1$ $\\nu_2$ $\\nu_3$ $\\nu_d$ $\\nu_{ee}$ $\\eta_3$ Value 0.01 0.3 0.1 0.05 0.5 0.3 We can visualise what changing the parameters does by plotting the default solution in the x-direction along wih a few altered solutions. Plotting at $t=0.1$ s for $\\nu_1 = 10$, and for $\\nu_d=7$ yields: Not focusing too much on the specific internal energy, as mentioned above, we can see that the \"bump\" in horizontal velocity gets softened out more when we increase the value of $\\nu_1$. As we increase $\\nu_d$, there is little change, but it may appear that the \"bump\" also gets a little softened, thus straying further from the reference solution in Stone et al. Compiling with the Ramses HLLD solver Using the Ramses solver with the default settings yields the following figure: We can see immediately that the velocity plot much more closely resembles the reference plot in Stone et al. , clearly showing the \"bump\" in the horizontal velocity around the center of the plot. In order to fine-tune the Ramses solver, we can vary the slope parameter, which is initially set to be slope=3.5 . Setting this parameter to be $1$, $2$, and $3$, we can plot the resulting solutions at $t=0.1$ s: Here we can see that tuning the slope parameter does very little in terms of the overall shape of the graph. There is a small difference in the slope of the density pressure plots, at the points where the graph start to drop from $\\rho=1.0$ and $P=0.40$ respectively. In the solution with slope=2 , this is visible at the very top of the central curve. Something that might also be worth noting, is that for the initial Ramses setting slope=3.5 , the specific internal velocity gets an unfamilliar shape. Since this plot generally is a point of uncertainty in this report, it may not be significant. However, we can observe that using slope=1 and slope=3 produces a $P/\\rho$-plot that more closely resembles the shape seen in the reference figure.","title":"Einfeld-1203"},{"location":"einfeld/#the-einfeld-1203-strong-rarefaction-test","text":"In Einfeldt et al.

But now with the solver=ramses/hlld instead. Where the original slope parameter is 3.5 . We get the following Where we see that the change of slope has very litte effect on the domain. Except for the intersection between the left and right. But interestingly for a slope parameter of one the simulation crashes after one timestep.","title":"Ramses"},{"location":"shu-osher/","text":"MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\\\(','\\\\)']], processEscapes: true}, jax: [\"input/TeX\",\"input/MathML\",\"input/AsciiMath\",\"output/CommonHTML\"], extensions: [\"tex2jax.js\",\"mml2jax.js\",\"asciimath2jax.js\",\"MathMenu.js\",\"MathZoom.js\",\"AssistiveMML.js\", \"[Contrib]/a11y/accessibility-menu.js\"], TeX: { extensions: [\"AMSmath.js\",\"AMSsymbols.js\",\"noErrors.js\",\"noUndefined.js\"], equationNumbers: { autoNumber: \"AMS\" } } }); Current branch: develop-bc Current commit: 164f010 Shu Osher test We will be comparing our solvers' solutions to the Shu-Osher test with the plots provided by the University of Rochester in their report on hydrodynamics test problems . AS a reference, they provided these figures of the density, x-velocity and pressure in the x-direction. The Shu-Osher test uses the initial values: $$\\rho$$ $$v_x$$ $$v_y$$ $$v_z$$ $$P$$ $$B_x$$ $$B_z$$ Left side 3.857143 2.629369 0 0 10.3333 ... ... Right side $$1+0.2 \\sin(5\\pi x)$$ 0 0 0 1 ... ... Bifrost Reproducing the test using our Bifrost solver with standard configuration (and simultaneously testing the x-, y- and z-directions) yields the result: Here we have used $t = 1.8$ s as the end time of the simulation. We can see that our Bifrost solution of the Shu-Osher test replicates the reference figure very accurately. The time evolution of the Shu-Osher test in the x-, y- and z-directions very nicely shows us the shock wave travelling along the x-axis: The initial configuration for the Bifrost solver is: Parameter $\\nu_1$ $\\nu_2$ $\\nu_3$ $\\nu_d$ $\\nu_{ee}$ $\\eta_3$ Value 0.01 0.3 0.1 0.05 0.5 0.3 By changing these parameters, we can fine-tune the solution and see if it fits the reference figure even better. We begin by changing the parameters such that $\\nu_1=10.01$ and $\\nu_{ee} = 1.05$, because changing either parameter any less yelds an unnoticable result. The plots are shown below: We can see that the curve for $\\nu_1 = 10.01$ deviates the most from the reference figure, in which the \"turns\" on the wavelike shapes are very sharp. By increasing $\\nu_1$ a lot, these sharp angles soften out. Ramses HLLD solver We can compare our Bifrost solution with the figure we get when we run the Ramses HLLD solver instead, using the default slope parameter set to $3.5$. In the x-, y- and z-directions, this yields: Just like we saw with the Bifrost solver, Ramses is also able to reproduce the reference figure very accurately. By changing the slope parameter to $1$ and $2$ respectively, we can see if we are able to fine-tune it even further. The results are plotted below: It is apparent that changing the slope parameter does not change the solution in any noticeable way, at least when we are only looking at the final time step.","title":"Shu-Osher"},{"location":"shu-osher/#shu-osher-test","text":"We will be comparing our solvers' solutions to the Shu-Osher test with the plots provided by the University of Rochester in their report on hydrodynamics test problems .
